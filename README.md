                                        Introduction to Zomato Restaurant Analysis 

This project aims to analyze and visualize restaurant data from Pune, India, in light of the city's growing restaurant industry. Evaluating various parameters such as ratings, reviews, cuisines, and services is essential for understanding customer preferences and providing insights into restaurant performance. The dataset includes information about prominent restaurants in Pune, each offering unique dining experiences characterized by cuisine variety, customer ratings, and services. By exploring this data, we seek to identify trends in customer satisfaction, preferences, and overall restaurant performance.

                                         Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
  * To analyze and compare the performance of selected restaurants based on customer ratings, reviews, and vote counts.
  * To evaluate the services offered by these restaurants, including amenities such as parking, live music, Wi-Fi, and alcohol availability.
  * To explore the relationship between restaurant features (such as cuisine types, location, and cost for two) and overall customer satisfaction.

                                         Tasks
Data Collection and Preparation:
  * Collected data for each restaurant, including ratings, reviews, service features, and contact information.

  * Cleaned the dataset by addressing missing values and adjusting data types where necessary.

  * Organized the data into a structured table format, ensuring each column is correctly categorized (e.g., numerical values for ratings and votes, text for cuisine types).



Data visualization: Developed various visualizations to represent the Pune restaurant data:

  * Pie Charts: Analyzed the availability of home delivery services across different restaurants.
  * Map Charts: Illustrated the number of restaurants located in various areas.
  * Area Charts: Displayed the distribution of restaurant payment methods, including cash, digital payments, and meal coupons.
  * Waterfall Charts: Showed the minimum charges for two people categorized by cuisine type.
  * Clustered Bar Chart: Analyzed and compared restaurant reviews.

                                          Dashboard & Report
* Consolidated all visualizations into an interactive Power BI dashboard.
* Incorporated filters (slicers) to enable users to interact with the data based on star ratings, reviews, or sponsored content.

                                            Challenges
  
Subjective Ratings: 
  * Customer ratings and reviews are inherently subjective; while they offer valuable insights, they can be influenced by individual preferences and biases.

Service Comparisons: 
  * Not all services are directly comparable across restaurants, as some features (e.g., live music, home delivery) may not be offered by all establishments, limiting the effectiveness of direct comparisons.

Missing Data: 
  * Certain service features, such as Wi-Fi or free parking, may not apply to all restaurants, and failing to account for these gaps can distort the analysis.

Analysis Limitations: 
  * The variability in available services and the subjective nature of customer feedback may affect the overall reliability and accuracy of the insights drawn from the data.

                                            Final Report
The final report will include:
* Data Overview: A summary of the data structure and parameters used for analysis, such as restaurant names, localities, ratings, and votes.
* Key Insights: Major findings, including the top-performing restaurant, the most valued service features, and the relationship between review percentages and customer satisfaction.
* Recommendations: Actionable suggestions for restaurant owners and potential customers on factors to prioritize for improvement or decision-making.
